# NFL Defensive Leaders (128x32)
#
# The top 3 defensive leaders in one stat per page (Total Tackles, Solo
# Tackles, Sacks, Interceptions, Passes Defended, TFL, Forced Fumbles,
# Defensive TDs), for NFL overall, the AFC, or the NFC. Assisted Tackles was
# dropped (2026-09-16, Chris's call) - Total already equals Solo + Assisted,
# so all three was redundant, and Assisted alone is the least-looked-up of
# the three; Solo stayed as the one meaningful individual cut beside Total.
# Passes Defended took the freed slot (same session) - unlike the "general"
# category's fumblesForced/fumblesRecovered/fumblesTouchdowns fields, ESPN's
# sort actually works correctly for defensive.passesDefended (confirmed live
# against a 15-deep sorted sample), so this one didn't need the pooled/
# computed workaround Forced Fumbles does. Defensive TDs later replaced
# the standalone Pick Six page (same session) - Pick Six (interception
# return TDs only) was already a strict subset of Defensive TDs
# (interception + fumble return TDs combined), so once the combined stat
# existed there was no reason to keep the narrower one too. Forced Fumbles
# then replaced the original Fumble Recoveries page (same session, Chris's
# call) - forcing a fumble is a real, attributable defensive skill, while
# recovering one is largely positional luck (whichever body happens to be
# closest when it bounces), so Forced is the more meaningful individual
# stat of the two. Same pooled/computed workaround either way, just reading
# general idx 1 (fumblesForced) instead of idx 2 (fumblesRecovered). Data
# from ESPN's public stats-by-athlete API (site.web.api.espn.com) - no key
# required. Sibling app to nfl-offensive-leaders and
# nfl-special-teams-leaders, ported from
# mlb-offensive-leaders's own redesign (2026-09-15 review, PR #542) - same
# scorebook layout, a league/conference badge and football colors instead of
# baseball/league.
#
# Pages in this SDK are a fixed list declared in the manifest, so all 8
# category pages always exist.
#
# DESIGN. Same scorebook as mlb-offensive-leaders and nfl-offensive-leaders,
# on a black ground. The top row opens directly on the league badge - AFC
# red or NFC blue solid when a conference is picked, and the NFL shield
# (white rim, navy star band over red) for plain "NFL" with no conference
# filter, which reads as the league at a glance where a red/blue split pill
# didn't - then the stat in white and the season in gray. Under it, three
# rows: the rank in gray, a team badge, the last name in white, and the number in white against the
# right edge. The badge is how a fan spots
# their team across a room: the team's code in its own two colors, like a
# helmet decal. Everything stays 6px inside both edges so the app reads as
# its own unit in the stream.

# id: [code, fill, ink]. Fill is the color the team wears most, ink its
# accent. A few inks are brightened from the team's literal secondary shade
# where it read as unreadable-dark text at 4x5 against this fill - Falcons
# (was black on dark red), Ravens (was black on purple), Panthers (was black
# on medium blue), Eagles (was black on dark green), Buccaneers (was dark
# pewter on dark red), and Bills/Patriots (both reds pushed brighter off
# navy) - the same category of fix mlb-offensive-leaders made for its own
# reds.
